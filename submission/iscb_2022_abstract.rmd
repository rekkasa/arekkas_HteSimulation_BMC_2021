# Abstract
Our objective was to compare different risk-based methods for optimal prediction
of individualized treatment effects from RCTs.

We simulated RCT data using diverse assumptions for the average treatment
effect, a baseline prognostic index of risk (PI), the shape of its interaction
with treatment (none, linear, quadratic or non-monotonic) and the magnitude of
treatment-related harms (none or constant independent of the PI). The
combination of these settings resulted in the definition of 648 simulation
scenarios. In each sample we predicted absolute benefit using: models with a
constant relative treatment effect; stratification in quarters of the PI; models
including a linear interaction of treatment with the PI; models including an
interaction of treatment with a restricted cubic spline (RCS) transformation of
the PI; an adaptive approach using Akaikeâ€™s Information Criterion. We evaluated
predictive performance using root mean squared error and measures of
discrimination and calibration for benefit.

The linear-interaction model and the RCS-interaction model outperformed the
constant treatment effect model in many simulation scenarios. The RCS-model was
optimal when quadratic or non-monotonic deviations from a constant treatment
effect were stronger, and when sample size was larger. Larger sample size also
supported the adaptive approach. All the simulation results can be explored at
https://arekkas.shinyapps.io/simulation_viewer/. We also illustrated the
application of the considered methods in the GUSTO-I trial, which confirmed our
simulations' findings.

In conclusion, an interaction between baseline risk and treatment assignment
should be considered to improve treatment effect predictions. Non-linear
interactions should be considered only in larger sample sizes.
