# Simulation settings
For all patients we observe covariates $x_1,\dots,x_8$, of which $4$ are
continuous and $4$ are binary. More specifically,

\begin{equation*}
x_1,\dots,x_4 \sim N(0, 1)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
x_5,\dots,x_8 \sim B(1, 0.2)
\end{equation*}

We first, generate the binary outcomes $y$ for the untreated patients ($t_x=0$), based on 

\begin{equation} 
P(y\given \bm{x}, t_x=0) = g(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_8x_8) = g(lp_0),
(\#eq:p0)
\end{equation}

where $$g(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$$

For treated patients, outcomes are generated from:

\begin{equation}
P(y\given\bm{x}, t_x=1) = g(lp_1)
(\#eq:p1)
\end{equation}


where $$lp_1 = \gamma_2(lp_0-c)^2+\gamma_1(lp_0-c)+\gamma_0$$

## Base-case scenario
The base-case scenario assumes a constant odds ratio of $0.8$ in favor of treatment. The simulated datasets are of size $n=4250$, where treatment is allocated at random using a 50/50 split (80% power for the detection of an unadjusted OR of 0.8, assuming an event rate of 20% in the untreated arm). Outcome incidence in the untreated population is set at $20\%$. For the development of the prediction model we use the model defined in \@ref(eq:p0) including a constant treatment effect. When doing predictions, $t_x$ is set to $0$. The value of the true $\bm{\beta}$ is such that the above prediction model has an AUC of $0.75$.


The previously defined targets are achieved when $\bm{\beta}=(-2.08, 0.49,\dots,0.49)^t$. For the derivations in the treatment arm we use $\bm{\gamma}=(\log(0.8), 1, 0)^t$.

## Deviations from base-case
We deviate from the base-case scenario in two ways. First, we alter the overall target settings of sample size, overall treatment effect and prediction model AUC. In a second stage, we consider settings that violate the assumption of a constant relative treatment effect, using a model-based approach.

For the first part, we consider:

* Sample size:
  + $n=1064$
  + $n=17000$
* Overall treatment effect:
  + $OR=0.5$
  + $OR=1$
* Prediction performance:
  + $AUC=0.65$
  + $AUC=0.85$
  
We set the true risk model coefficients to be $\bm{\beta} = \big(-1.63, 0.26,\dots,0.26\big)^t$ for $AUC=0.65$ and $\bm{\beta} = \big(-2.7, 0.82,\dots,0.82\big)^t$ for $AUC=0.85$. In both cases, $\beta_0$ is selected so that an event rate of $20\%$ is maintained in the control arm.  

For the second part linear and quadratic deviations from the assumption of
constant relative effect are considered. We also consider different intensity
levels of these deviations. The settings for these deviations are defined in
Table \@ref(tab:tab1) and result in the effects of Figure
\@ref(fig:fig1). 

```{r fig1, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Linear and quadratic deviations from the base-case scenario of constant relative effect (OR=0.8)", fig.show="hold", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/deviate_linear_08.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/deviate_quadratic_08.png"))
```

In Figure \@ref(fig:fig2) the absolute benefits observed based on different
settings are presented. The base-case scenario is also presented as a reference.

```{r fig2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Linear and quadratic deviations from the base-case scenario of constant relative effect (OR=0.8)", fig.show="hold", out.width = '50%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/deviate_linear_absolute_08.png"))
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/deviate_quadratic_absolute_08.png"))
```

Finally, we consider 3 additional scenarios of interaction of individual
covariates with treatment. These scenarios include a 4 weak interactions
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.82$), 4 strong interactions ($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.61$), and 2 weak and 2 strong interactions (Table \@ref(tab:tab2)).

## Risk modeling
Merging treatment arms, we develop prediction models including a constant relative treatment effect:

\begin{equation}
E\{y\given x,t_x\} = P(y\given x, t_x) = g(\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_8x_8+\gamma t_x)
\end{equation}
(\#eq:risk)
Individualized predictions are derived setting $t_x=0$.

## Approaches to individualize benefit predictions

### Risk stratification
Derive a prediction model using the same approach as above and divide the
population in equally sized risk-based subgroups. Estimate subgroup-specific
absolute benefit from the observed absolute differences. Subject-specific
benefit predictions are made by attributing to individuals their corresponding
subgroup-specific estimate.

### Constant treatment effect
Assuming a constant relative treatment effect, fit the adjusted model in
\@ref(eq:risk). Then, an estimate of absolute benefit can be derived from$$\hat{f}_{\text{benefit}}(lp\given \bm{x}, \hat{\bm{\beta}}) = g(lp) - g(lp+\hat{\gamma}) $$

### Linear interaction
The assumption of constant relative treatment effect is relaxed modeling a
linear interaction of treatment with the risk linear predictor:
$$E\{y\given \bm{x}, t_x, \hat{\bm{\beta}}\} = g\big(lp+(\gamma_0+\gamma_1lp)t_x\big)$$
We predict absolute benefit from $$\hat{f}_{\text{benefit}}(lp\given\bm{x}, \hat{\bm{\beta}}) = g(lp) - g\big(\gamma_0+(1+\gamma_1)lp\big)$$

### Restricted cubic splines
Finally, we drop the linearity assumption and predict absolute benefit using
smoothing with restricted cubic splines with 3, 4, and 5 knots. More
specifically, we fit the model:

$$P(y=1\given lp, t_x) = g\big(\beta_0+\beta_{t_x}t_x+f_{RCS}(lp) + f_{RCS}(lp)\times t_x\big)$$
where
$$f_{RCS}(x)=\alpha_0+\alpha_1h_1(x)+\alpha_2h_2(x)+\dots+\alpha_{k-1}h_{k-1}(x)$$ with
$$h_{j+1}(x)= (x-t_j)^3-(x-t_{k-1})_+\frac{t_k-t_j}{t_k-t_{k-1}}+(x-t_k)^3_+\frac{t_{k-1}-t_j}{t_k-t_{k-   1}}$$
and $t_1,\dots,t_k$ are the selected knots. We predict absolute benefit from $$\hat{f}_{\text{benefit}}(lp \given \bm{x},\hat{\bm{\beta}})=P(y=1\given lp, t_x=0)-P(y=1\given lp,t_x=1)$$.

# Results in scenarios with interactions

When we considered a set of 4 true linear treatment-covariate interactions the
model containing a linear interaction with the prognostic index had the lowest
median RMSE. We observed an increasing trend in prediction errors with
increasing interaction intensity (Figure \@ref(fig:rmseInteractions)). The
model with restricted cubic spline smoothing (3 knots) had very comparable
performance to the linear interaction model. Increasing the flexibility of the
smooth methods resulted in increasing median RMSE. These results may be
explained by the fact that the interactions considered were linear, thus
favoring the linear interaction model. More flexible approaches may be better
suited for higher-order treatment-covariate interactions. Finally, the adaptive
approach had adequate performance under all scenarios, resembling the
performance of the best-performing approach every time.

```{r rmseInteractions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Linear and quadratic deviations from the base-case scenario of constant relative effect (OR=0.8)", fig.show="hold", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/rmse_interactions.png"))
```

The constant treatment effects model, the linear interaction model and the model
with RCS smoothing (3 knots) had the highest c-for-benefit across all scenarios
(Figrue \@ref(fig:discriminationInteractions)). RCS smoothing with 4 or 5 knots
did not improve performance. On the contrary, we observed an increasing trend in
c-for-benefit variability, as was the case in the main text. The adaptive
apprach again had statisfactory performance.

```{r discriminationInteractions, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="Linear and quadratic deviations from the base-case scenario of constant relative effect (OR=0.8)", fig.show="hold", out.width = '100%'}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("figures/discrimination_interactions.png"))
```

Despite the very similar performance in terms of prediction errors, the linear
interaction model resulted in better-calibrated benefit predictions compared to
the rest of the methods (Figure \@ref(fig:calibrationInteractions)). The constant
treatment effects model had the highest median ICI-for-benefit across all
scenario settings, which became more pornounced with increasing
treatment-covariate interaction intensity.

# Case study

We fitted a logistic regression model to predict 30-day mortality after a
myocardial infarction using data from the GUSTO-I trial. The risk factors
modeled were age, Killip class, systolic blood pressure heart rate, primary MI
and MI location. We restricted systolic blood pressure values to 120 mmHg and
modeled heart rate using linear spline transformation with a knot at 50 beats
per minute. A brief overview of the distribution of baseline characteristics is
presented in Table \@ref(tab:table1). The coefficients of the model can be seen
in Table \@ref(tab:modelCoefficients). We used this model in the manuscript to
derive baseline risk predictions to all patients of the study. For all patients
we set the treatment indicator to 0, assuming a constant relative treatment
effect. The model displayed very good internal validity (Table
\@ref(tab:internalValidity)).

We used the derived prediction model to predict benefit of tPA to 30-day
mortality using the data at hand. The models are presented in the main
manuscript. All approaches displayed comaprable discrimination for benefit, with
the constant treatment effect model, the linear interaction model and the RCS (5
knots) model displaying the highest performance (Table
\@ref(tab:gustoPerformanceMetrics)). However, the linear interaction model and
the RCS (5 knots) model were worse calibrated. The constant treatment effect
model also had the best performance among the considered methods in terms of
calibration for benefit.
