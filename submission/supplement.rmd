# Simulation settings
For all patients we observe covariates $x_1,\dots,x_8$, of which $4$ are
continuous and $4$ are binary. More specifically,

\begin{equation*}
x_1,\dots,x_4 \sim N(0, 1)
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
x_5,\dots,x_8 \sim B(1, 0.2)
\end{equation*}

We first, generate the binary outcomes $y$ for the untreated patients ($t_x=0$),
based on

\begin{equation} 
P(y\given \bm{x}, t_x=0) = g(\beta_0 + \beta_1x_1+\dots+\beta_8x_8) = g(lp_0),
(\#eq:p0)
\end{equation}

where $$g(x) = \frac{e^x}{1+e^x}$$

For treated patients, outcomes are generated from:

\begin{equation}
P(y\given\bm{x}, t_x=1) = g(lp_1)
(\#eq:p1)
\end{equation}


where $$lp_1 = \gamma_2(lp_0-c)^2+\gamma_1(lp_0-c)+\gamma_0$$

## Base-case scenario
The base-case scenario assumes a constant odds ratio of $0.8$ in favor of
treatment. The simulated datasets are of size $n=4250$, where treatment is
allocated at random using a 50/50 split (80% power for the detection of an
unadjusted OR of 0.8, assuming an event rate of 20% in the untreated
arm). Outcome incidence in the untreated population is set at $20\%$. For the
development of the prediction model we use the model defined in \@ref(eq:p0)
including a constant treatment effect. When doing predictions, $t_x$ is set to
$0$. The value of the true $\bm{\beta}$ is such that the above prediction model
has an AUC of $0.75$.


The previously defined targets are achieved when $\bm{\beta}=(-2.08,
0.49,\dots,0.49)^t$. For the derivations in the treatment arm we use
$\bm{\gamma}=(\log(0.8), 1, 0)^t$.

## Deviations from base-case
We deviate from the base-case scenario in two ways. First, we alter the overall
target settings of sample size, overall treatment effect and prediction model
AUC. In a second stage, we consider settings that violate the assumption of a
constant relative treatment effect, using a model-based approach.

For the first part, we consider:

* Sample size:
  + $n=1064$
  + $n=17000$
* Overall treatment effect:
  + $OR=0.5$
  + $OR=1$
* Prediction performance:
  + $AUC=0.65$
  + $AUC=0.85$
  
We set the true risk model coefficients to be
$\bm{\beta} = \big(-1.63,0.26,\dots,0.26\big)^t$ for $AUC=0.65$ and $\bm{\beta} = \big(-2.7,0.82,\dots,0.82\big)^t$ 
for $AUC=0.85$. In both cases, $\beta_0$ is selected so that an event rate of
$20\%$ is maintained in the control arm.

For the second part linear, quadratic and non-monotonic deviations from the
assumption of constant relative effect are considered. We also consider
different intensity levels of these deviations. Finally, constant absolute
treatment-related harms are introduced, i.e. positive 
($0.25\times\text{true average benefit}$),
strong positive ($0.50\times\text{true average benefit}$) and negative
($-0.25\times\text{true average benefit}$; i.e. constant absolute
treatment-related benefit). In case of true absent treatment effects,
treatment-related harms are set to $1\%, 2\%$ and $-1\%$ for positive, strong
positive and negative setting, respectively. The settings for these deviations
are defined in Table \@ref(tab:tab1).

# Plausible scenario settings

In this section we present specific scenarios from our simulation settings in
which evolution of benefit followed similar patterns to [@Kent2016]. In this
case patients were stratified into risk quarters based on their true baseline
risk. Within each risk quarter we constructed boxplots of true benefit.

# Approaches to individualize benefit predictions

## Risk modeling
Merging treatment arms, we develop prediction models including a constant relative treatment effect:

\begin{equation}
P(y=1\given\bm{x}, t_x) = g(\bm{x}^t\bm{\beta} + \gamma t_x)
\end{equation}
(\#eq:risk)

The risk linear predictor is then 
$lp(\bm{x}; \bm{\beta}) = \bm{x}^t\bm{\beta}$. 
We derive baseline risk predictions for patients by setting $t_x=0$ in
\@ref(eq:risk). All methods for individualizing benefit predictions are 2-stage
methods, that start by fitting a model for predicting baseline risk. The
estimated linear predictor of this model is

\begin{equation*}
\hat{lp} = lp(\bm{x};\hat{\bm{\beta}}) = \bm{x}^t\hat{\bm{\beta}}
\end{equation*}

## Risk stratification
Derive a prediction model using the same approach as above and divide the
population in equally sized risk-based subgroups. Estimate subgroup-specific
absolute benefit from the observed absolute differences. Subject-specific
benefit predictions are made by attributing to individuals their corresponding
subgroup-specific estimate.

## Constant treatment effect
Assuming a constant relative treatment effect, fit the adjusted model in
\@ref(eq:risk). Then, an estimate of absolute benefit can be derived from
$$\tau(lp;  \hat{\bm{\beta}}, \hat{\gamma}) = g(\hat{lp}) - g(\hat{lp}+\hat{\gamma}) $$

## Linear interaction
The assumption of constant relative treatment effect is relaxed modeling a
linear interaction of treatment with the risk linear predictor: 

$$P(y=1\given lp, t_x;\hat{\bm{\beta}}) = g(\delta_0 + \delta_1\hat{lp} +
\gamma_0t_x + \gamma_1\hat{lp}t_x)$$

Then the predicted absolute benefit is 
$$\tau(lp;\hat{\bm{\beta}},\bm{\gamma}, \bm{\delta}) = g(\delta_0 +
\delta_1\hat{lp}) - g\big((\delta_0+\gamma_0) + (\delta_1+\gamma_1)\hat{lp}\big)$$

## Restricted cubic splines
Finally, we drop the linearity assumption and predict absolute benefit using
smoothing with restricted cubic splines with $k=3, 4$ and $5$ knots. More
specifically, we fit the model:

$$P(y=1|lp, t_x;\hat{\bm{\beta}}, \bm{\delta}, f_{RCS}) = g\big(\delta_0 + \gamma
t_x +f_{RCS}(\hat{lp})\times t_x\big)$$
where
$$f_{RCS}(x)=\alpha_0+\alpha_1h_1(x)+\alpha_2h_2(x)+\dots+\alpha_{k-1}h_{k-1}(x)$$
with $h_1(x)=x$ and for $j=2,\dots,k-2$
$$h_{j+1}(x)= (x-t_j)^3-(x-t_{k-1})_+^3 \frac{t_k-t_j}{t_k-t_{k-1}}+(x-t_k)^3_+\frac{t_{k-1}-t_j}{t_k-t_{k-1}}$$
where 
$t_1,\dots,t_k$ are the selected knots. We predict absolute benefit from 
$$ \tau(lp; \hat{\bm{\beta}}, \delta_0, f_{RCS}) = P(y=1\given\hat{lp},
t_x=0) - P(y=1\given \hat{lp}, t_x=1) $$

# Treatment interactions

We carried out a smaller set of simulations, in which we assumed true
treatment-covariate interactions. Sample size was set to 4,250 and the AUC of
the true prediction model was set to 0.75. The following scenarios were
considered: 1) 4 true weak positive interactions
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.83$); 2) 4 strong positive
interactions ($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=0.61$); 3) 2 weak and 2
strong positive interactions; 4) 4 weak negative interactions 
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=1.17$); 5) 4 strong negative interactions 
($\text{OR}_{t_x=1} / \text{OR}_{t_x=0}=1.39$); 6) 2 weak and 2 strong negative
interactions; 7) combined positive and negative strong interactions. We also
considered constant treatment-related harms applied on the absolute scale to all
treated patients. The exact settings were: 1) absent treatment-related harms; 2)
moderate treatment-related harms, defined as 25\% of the average true benefit of the
scenario without treatment-related harms; 3) strong treatment-related harms
defined as 50\% of the true average benefit of the scenario without
treatment-related harms; 4) negative treatment-related harms (benefit), defined
as an absolute risk reduction for treated patients of 50\% of the true average
benefit of the scenario without treatment-related harms. The exact settings can
be found in Table \@ref(tab:tab2).
