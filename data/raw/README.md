# Raw data

Here the raw data of the simulations will be stored. These are:
- An `evaluation.rds` object with the results for:
	- *rmse*
	- *discrimination for benefit*
	- *calibration for benefit*
	- the selections of the *adaptive model*.
- A `settings.rds` object with the settings for:
	- the analysis
	- the simulation scenario
	- the internal prediction model development
	- the continuous benefit prediction models
- A `log.txt` with the logged information of running the simulations for the
	specific scenario.
