<h2>Abstract</h2>
<p><b>Objective:</b> Simulation study to compare different risk-based approaches to
  estimating individualized treatment effects within the RCT setting. <b>Study Design and Setting:</b>
  Starting from a base case scenario that assumes a true
constant treatment effect, we considered a total of 66 scenarios for introducing
non-constant effects and evaluating methods under different sample sizes and
baseline risk prediction performance. We compared 7 methods for predicting
absolute benefit: A constant treatment effect model, a risk stratified approach,
a model including a linear interaction of the baseline risk linear predictor
with treatment, 3 restricted cubic spline smoothing models of increasing
flexibility (3, 4 and 5 knots) and an adaptive model selection method based on
Akaike's Information Criterion. We evaluated performance using root mean squared
error, discrimination for benefit and calibration for benefit (i.e., observed
vs. predicted risk difference in treated vs. untreated). <b>Results:</b> The model
including a linear interaction of the risk linear predictor with treatment had
adequate performance that was robust under the majority of the simulation
scenarios. Methods using restricted cubic spline smoothing required larger
sample sizes and higher prediction AUC to achieve adequate performance. The
adaptive approach's performance was comparable to the performance of the best
model in each scenario. <b>Conclusion:</b> In most cases using a model just
including a linear interaction of the risk linear predictor with treatment
adequately predicts absolute benefit.
